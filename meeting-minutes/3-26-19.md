##Recap from the last meetup
[link](3-12-19.html)

If you didn't manage to come to the last meetup check out the blog posts which Roberto put together for the [last meetup](3-12-19.html). They are an excellent resource to get familiarized with the basics of Reversing Engineering Embedded Firmware devices. If you need a copy of the firmware feel free to ping Roberto or I on slack, I'll be more than happy to provide it to you but for legal reasons, don't want to host it publicly on the site. 

##Agenda

This meetup will be free-form.
