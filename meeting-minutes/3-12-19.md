##Agenda

Roberto has put together an introduction to reverse engineering embedded firmware using real-world devices. There will be a practical demonstration, where he will show how exactly he took apart the devices, and reverse engineered them, and then time for us to poke at the firmware ourselves. He has written about them on his Github page, the links are below.

There first link contains some instructions on how to setup your test environment. You should try and come to the event with an Ubuntu VM setup. There are plenty of tutorials on how do so online, here is one on how to setup Ubuntu on Windows using Virtualbox (http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox)

Here are some extra resources regarding the topic of embedded and hardware hacking if you are interested in learning more.
