# Cybernaut CTF Team

Welcome to the github repo of the Cybernaut CTF Team.  Here you will find resources, walkthroughs, and projects involving our monthly CTF meetups in the Austin, Texas area.

## Getting Started

We are aiming to meet biweekly at Indeed's Tech Campus located at 6433 Champion Grandview way. We meet on Tuesday and the meeting lasts from 5PM-11PM, all upcoming meetings will be posted on here or you can find us on Eventbrite. All you need to participate is a functional laptop, although learning and practice outside the group is expected to maintain pace with the rest of the group

You can find our [meeting minutes here](meeting-minutes/)
We also have a [list of useful resources](resources/) that we are compiling.

## Next Meeting!
